            <h2>EXPRESS YOURSELF</h2>
            <p>Are you tired of letting the world dictate what you should or shouldn't do? <br>
                <br>
                In 'The Responsible Self', Robert Baird says that learning how to express yourself in a productive way
                is essential to living an authentic, confident and healthy life.
                Often we keep our emotions to ourselves because we are fearful of the potential backlash our words or
                actions might create. But the key is to express yourself in a way that produces a positive result both
                internally as well as externally.
                Below are 4 tips to effectively express yourself to improve your mental health, as well as help people
                around you, understand your point of view.
