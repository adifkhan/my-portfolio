            <h2>EXPRESS YOURSELF</h2>
            <h4>Are you tired of letting the world dictate what you should or shouldn't do?</h4>
            <p>In 'The Responsible Self', Robert Baird says that learning how to express yourself in a productive way
                is essential to living an authentic, confident and healthy life.
                Often we keep our emotions to ourselves because we are fearful of the potential backlash our words or
                actions might create. But the key is to express yourself in a way that produces a positive result both
                internally as well as externally.
                Below are 4 tips to effectively express yourself to improve your mental health, as well as help people
                around you, understand your point of view.

            <p>We all think that we know our limits. We know what we're good at and we work towards improving ourselves
                in the set direction. We set goals that will bring us closer to our definition of success, or else, the
                end journey. <br>What if you've tested your limits even beyond reaching the dead end to explore
                different paths? <br> Everything starts with your mindset. You are what you think. That's why we are all
                responsible for limiting ourselves to what we can imagine as a definition of success. Or even worse, we
                are limiting ourselves to what it's easier to be achieved. This way, we still feel successful and enjoy
                the benefits of it.</p>
